# Strata

A UI Component System for isomorphic rendering in ASP.Net.

---

## Purpose



## Isomorphic

In this case it means that the data templating in the UI components happens the same both on the server and the client.



## Templating

Currently Strata uses the Mustache template language because of it's wide use and many cross platform implementations.

Also, it's convenient for me because my default use case for Strata is with Backbone and Underscore components using the mustache data templating syntax.
